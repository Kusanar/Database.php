Snippet from "More information", Database() documentaion:

	Database() intends to be an efficient database wrapper with a large set of features,
	with a main target of improving development time on little and big projects, in part
	avoiding partial code rewrites on big-growing websites or SQL chunks in little websites.
	
	No new features are planned, only security and compatibility updates will take place
	(infrequent updates). Database() is built as a common, full-featured database wrapper
	(to build things in its top), not as an evolving tool.
	
	Code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License (A.K.A. LGPL), version 3.
